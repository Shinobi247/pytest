## Release notes

<!--
Release notes are sent to the Slack solution channel when a new version is deployed to an environment.
Release notes should include changes that are meaningful for your team. These will not be shown in the UI.

Insert release notes between START and END tags below. Leave release notes empty if you don't want to include anything in the release notes. This will be automatically picked up by Github Action when deploying to an environment.
